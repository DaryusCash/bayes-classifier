# bayes classifier
This program was written on a MAC with Python 3.9 and Numpy installed. While it may run on later verisons of python Numpy is needed to run the program. The 
file paths located in DataProcess.py MUST be changed to fit the correct file system of your machine or it will not run. Once this is complete you can 
run each cell (if using vs code) to confirm the files are loading properly. Now find the file called Driver.py. Running this will preform task one and task two.
